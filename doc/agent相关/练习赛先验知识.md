### FRONT WING ANGLE

Increasing the front wing angle improves front downforce, which will bias the car's balancetowards cornering, and oversteer. Decrease to bias towards straights, braking stability andtraction.

### REAR WING ANGLE

Increasing rear wing angle will improve the car's rear downforce, which will bias the set-uptowards cornering, braking stability, and traction. Decreasing it biases set-up towardsstraights and oversteer

### ANTI-ROLL DISTRIBUTION

Distributing anti-roll bar stiffness towards the front of the car will improve stability and biasthe car towards braking stability and traction. Distributing towards the rear will improveresponsiveness and bias towards cornering and oversteer.

### TYRE CAMBER

Adding negative camber to the front tyres will improve the car's lateral grip, which will biasbalance towards cornering and oversteer. Removing it will improve longitudinal grip, biasingtowards braking stability and traction.

### TOE-OUT

Adding toe-out to the front tyres will bias the car's set-up towards braking stability and biasagainst cornering.
